# WEEKLY SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 1 Week Sprint_

For this project, I needed to create an application that records employee salaries and adds them up to report total monthly costs. 

The application needed to consist of a form with 5 input fields for an employee's information: first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. When info would be entered in those fields and a submit button was clicked, it would then be sent to a table below, creating a new employee entry and displaying their info. The input fields would then clear, allowing a new employee to be entered. 

The table would also need to feature a delete button for each employee, allowing for their entry to be removed. 

Lastly, at the bottom of the application, the total monthly cost would need to be displayed and updated as employees are added.  


To see the fully functional application, please open the index.html file in a browser.


### Prerequisites

-None


## Installation

Since the app only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle basic data input, display, and calculations, others should be able to open the index.html file directly in their browser to see it function without needing an IDE or running any setup commands.


## Usage
To see the application in action, we’ll run the following example:

1. We’ll start by adding the first employee. We’ll give them the name Jen Barber, employee ID 4521, their Title is Team Lead, and their salary is $80000.00.

2. Enter that information into the appropriate input fields, and then press the Submit button.

3. What should happen is that a new entry for Jen Barber is added to the Employees table below, showing the corresponding info for first name, last name, ID, Title, and Salary.

4. You should also see a Delete button next to the entry. Click this button. This should remove the employee from the table.

5. Repeat step 1 to add Jen Barber back to the table. 

6. Now, let’s add two more employees to the table. Here is their information:

Name: Maurice Moss
ID: 8724
Title: Support Team
Salary: $58000.00

Name: Roy Smith
ID: 9623
Title: Quality Assurance
Salary: $48000.00

7. As you add the employees to the table, you should see the Total Monthly amount in the footer update accordingly. 

*Note: the amount will show the total monthly cost of the employees combined salaries, not the sum of the annual salaries for the 3 employees.
